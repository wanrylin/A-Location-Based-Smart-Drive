## Project topics
Design and implement a cloud or local-computer based portal access smart drive system with any popular web browser on a computer or a cell phone/pad. User can drag and drop files to the portal interfacing area. The system will automatically put the files in different folders (on cloud or on your local computer) based on the real time location (name of the city) of the devices, such as “Vancouver”, “Surrey”, “Victoria”, “Burnaby”, “Coquitlam”, etc. If a new location is used, the system will automatically create a new folder for this new location and find out the city name of the location to use as the folder name, if the system cannot find the name of the city, the system will ask the user. The system will confirm after uploading (success/fail).
